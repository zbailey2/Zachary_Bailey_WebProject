                <h2>This is the main page for my project</h2>

                <!-- Paragraphs about the purpose of the website -->
                <p>This is the part of the website I made as an introduction for the professor. It follows the naming
                    conventions outlined, as well as allows for a quick explanation of my project. I created a tutorial
                    website for html and css in order to help others learn about the language while I was learning about
                    the languages as well. I created lessons which I followed examples from the book, as well as took
                    inspiration from the layouts of other tutorial websites as well as utilized some of their lessons in
                    order to get accurate information in order to display in my webpage. However I tried to make my
                    content unique by wording the concepts in a way that I understand. This part of the webpage,
                    specifically this file cannot be reached again once one of the other nav elements are clicked. This
                    is because this page is not apart of the website and is solely for the instructor. In the naming
                    conventions for this part of the assignment(Update #1 using GitHub) it specified that I should have
                    a core file convention named what this file is named. I didnt have one originally for my main file
                    was the index.html and that part of the assignment also outlined that should be kept for most
                    websites look for that and launch from there. I added this as a precaution because I know it is
                    expected, just did not know where it was expected to begin with.
