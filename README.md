My Web Design Project for my Final Project in Cs-2100 Intro To Web Development

The main purpose of this website is to serve as an HTML and css tutorial for beginners. It is not meant in any way to substitute for any other tutorial websites for the concepts are brief, and there may be some sections that are skipped. The purpose is to give a basic understanding to users who have no clue what HTML or CSS is and give an outline of some of the very basic uses of both HTML and CSS. The webpage includes 3 lessons for HTML, 3 lessons for CSS, a practice for each lesson that aligns with the lesson, and a test that goes over HTML and a test that goes over CSS. There is also a webpage about me, an area to leave feedback, and other helpful resources to learn more about CSS and HTML, many sources listed are ones I used to help create this webpage as well. The website functions as a normal website, so there is no real need to outline instructions on how to run it. This is a beginner project so if there is any feedback you have for the assignment, just submit it in the feedback section of the resources page!
