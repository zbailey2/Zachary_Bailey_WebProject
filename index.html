                <!-- Paragraphs about the purpose of the website -->
                <p>This is a website I am creating for my final project for my Web Development Class. The end goal for
                    this website is to create a learning resource that is accessible, user-friendly, and
                    includes multiple elements such as tables, JavaScript interactivity, and various concepts that I
                    have and will learn in class and through online tutorials.</p>

                <p>The website is designed to help beginners understand the basic aspects of HTML and CSS,
                    encouraging them to experiment and build their own web pages. Each lesson is structured to
                    introduce new concepts while using knowledge that has already been learned.</p>

                <p>This webpage includes lessons, interactive practices, resources I have use to build it, and examples
                    to
                    help people on their journey. Many of the resources I shared are the same ones I utilized to
                    learn specific elements necessary for creating this webpage, ensuring that the users have access to
                    the same content and tools.</p>
